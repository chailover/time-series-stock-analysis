# Time Series Stock Forecasting Project

This project aims to forecast stock prices or sales using time series analysis techniques. It encompasses data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Structure

```

├── data
│   ├── raw                # Contains raw data files collected from sources like yfinance or Kaggle.
│   ├── processed          # Holds cleaned and processed data files ready for analysis and modeling.
├── notebooks
│   ├── data_collection.ipynb   # Jupyter notebook for data collection using yfinance.

```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd time_series_forecasting
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for interactive data analysis and modeling.
- The `src` directory contains reusable Python scripts that can be imported into the notebooks or used independently.
- Ensure that the raw data is placed in the `data/raw` directory before running the data collection notebook.
